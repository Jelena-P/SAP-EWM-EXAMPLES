# SAP EWM Code Examples 

(Well, just one example for now.)

This program is a code example for creating an Outbound Delivery Order in SAP EWM for a Handling Unit (HU). See [this blog post](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/create-outbound-delivery-in-ewm-2025-edition/ba-p/14103014) for additional information.

Use abapGit to pull this program into your system. Or the source code can be simply copy-pasted since it's a single report. To adjust selection screen text, just go to the text elements and check the Dictionary checkboxes for all the parameters. 

Good luck!
